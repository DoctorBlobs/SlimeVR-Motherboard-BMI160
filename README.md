# SlimeVR Motherboard BMI 160

This is a project to make it easier to create SlimeVR trackers. This project reduces the amount of cable management needed when making SlimeVR trackers by providing a PCB that can be made for only $2. Beginner instructions on how to buy a PCB are below. Total cost should be around $55-60 for an enhanced core set excluding the cost of cases and straps.

## Parts and Setup

These PCB's use the official SlimeVR [Components](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html) and [Tracker Schematics](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/tracker-schematics.html). The PCB is compatible with The BMI160 and has locations for optional Battery Sense resistors and Charge Diodes. With this PCB, you will only need wire or a JST Connector for connecting the IMU's. 

All of the parts below are linked in the SlimeVR [Components](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html) guide.
This PCB is made for use with the following parts:

 - D1 Mini
 - TP4056 Charging Board (any connector)
 - 3.7V Batteries
 - SS22F32 DPDT Switch
 - BMI160
 - (Optional) 180k ohm Battery Sense Resistor
 - (Optional) 1N5817 Charge Diodes

3D printable cases for the SlimeVR Trackers are included in this repo. They require no supports and no hardware to put together. See the STL Files and Description below

## PCB Files

All PCB files are included in this repo in the KiCAD Schematic Folder. Please feel free to modify them as you see fit. KiCAD was use to create this project which is a free and opensource tool to create PCB's.
